# What's Your QM Interpretation?

A Buzzfeed-style quiz to discover your quantum mechanics interpretation.

## About

Quantum mechanics works. The math predicts experimental outcomes with extraordinary precision. But what does it *mean*?

Does the wavefunction describe reality, or just our knowledge? Does measurement create outcomes, reveal them, or branch the universe? Is randomness fundamental or just ignorance?

Physicists disagree. Philosophers disagree. This quiz won't settle it — but it might help you find your people.

## The Five Interpretations

| | Interpretation | Tagline |
|---|---|---|
| 🔬 | **Copenhagen** | "Shut up and calculate" |
| 🌳 | **Many-Worlds** | "Everything that can happen does happen" |
| 🎯 | **QBism** | "Quantum states are beliefs, not reality" |
| 🧭 | **Bohmian Mechanics** | "Particles have positions. Always." |
| 🔗 | **Relational QM** | "No view from nowhere" |

## Features

- **10 questions** probing the philosophical axes that actually differentiate interpretations
- **Simple Words mode** — toggle to rephrase everything using common vocabulary (~250 most common English words)
- **Score distribution** showing your tendencies across all five interpretations
- **Runner-up** interpretation for the philosophically promiscuous
- **No wrong answers** — they're empirically equivalent, remember?

## Why Simple Words?

QM interpretations are genuinely accessible ideas locked behind jargon. The "Simple Words" toggle rephrases everything without dumbing it down:

- "Ontology" → "what is really there"  
- "Observer-independent facts" → "facts that are true for everyone the same way"
- "Non-locality" → "things far away touching right away"

Same concepts, no gatekeeping.

*"All these interpretations give the same experimental predictions. None is 'right' in a testable way. Your choice reflects philosophical temperament as much as physics. That's not a bug — it's one of the deepest features of our current understanding."*
