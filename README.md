# QuantumQuiz
What kind of QM interpretation are you, through 10 simple questions

QQ is a quiz that's genuinely discriminating on the philosophical axes that actually differentiate interpretations:
The five categories used:

Copenhagen — pragmatist, anti-metaphysical, "prediction is enough"
Many-Worlds — systematizer, bullet-biter, ontological extravagance for elegance
QBism — agent-centric, Bayesian, states are beliefs
Bohmian — determinism-preserver, wants clear ontology, pays non-locality cost
Relational QM — no absolute facts, reality is interactions, process-oriented

Axes the questions probe:

Pragmatism vs. realism
Comfort with indeterminism
Observer-dependence tolerance
Ontological parsimony preferences
Locality intuitions
Realism vs. instrumentalism
Comfort with indeterminism
Observer-dependence tolerance
Ontological parsimony preferences
How you handle paradox

5 interpretations:

🔬 Copenhagen — "shut up and calculate"
🌳 Many-Worlds — bullet-biting systematizers
🎯 QBism — beliefs all the way down
🧭 Bohmian — determinism preserved at a cost
🔗 Relational QM — no view from nowhere

Results include:

The vibe (what you actually believe)
Why this works (steel-man the position)
The tensions (honest about the problems)
Your people (who to read)
You might also like (philosophical adjacent)
Score distribution across all five
Runner-up interpretation

Design choices:

Answers shuffled so position doesn't bias
Each answer has a "tone" subtitle (e.g., "Bayesian," "bullet-biter") that helps people learn the vocabulary
"No wrong answers (empirically equivalent, remember?)" as the footer
"Collapse the Wavefunction Again" as the reset button
